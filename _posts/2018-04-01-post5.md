## Get started 🚀

From what to start? Hi my name is Maris and I want to share with you some of my thoughts and experiences in programming. The first thing I have to say is that I am an apprentice, yes I am. When I was thinking which programming language will fit me the best?... I was so confused and I love the internet but I found so much information that I did not known what which was the best.
First of all, it all depends on what you would like to develop. The success story they told you. It is not the same for each person… please be yourself and find your own way.
There is a massive number of platforms, frameworks and in general languages with which you can develop your soon-to-be awesome skills.👩‍💻


## Tips

For Beginners who need some hints here is basic small overview of popular  languages an their implementations: Developing beautiful websites, HTML, CSS, Javascript, Java, Python.
Creating apps with Android SDK (for Android apps, based on Java), SWIFT (for IOS apps, based on objective-C)
Working with data, artificial intelligence, statistics you should use python. I love it.🐍
Ruby on Rails is easy if you can create amazing web application.



## End.

When starting with a chosen language might be a huge hustle and mess, Don’t worry, always remember what is your goal and which skills you wish get. 

From here I send you the best energy 🧡
