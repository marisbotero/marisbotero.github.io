R 
===========


Hi! Good to have you here. I am learning to program in R and I want to tell you so that it can be used.

## Get started


R programming has a Data Scientistâ€™s Toolbox:
1.  Exploratory Data Analysis
2.  Statistical Inference
3.  Regression Models
4.  Practical Machine Learning
5.  Developing Data Products



## Tip

R is open software and the good thing is that there are many tutorials ðŸŽ‰, if you are interested you can search Datacamp.
If you like it, why not give it a [star](https://www.datacamp.com/)



## End.

Thank you for taking the time to read I send you good energy and magic. ðŸŒŸ

 :).
